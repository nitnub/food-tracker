# Food App (In-Progress)

In-progress project for a web-based food and allergy tracking app I am working on. I plan to add this to [my portfolio](https://nickbryant.dev/) and deploy to Azure once I achieve MVP as defined below. This project is built with C# using the ASP.NET Core MVC framework. I plan to use Bootstrap for styling.

## Current MVP Requirements 
* User authentication
* All Food, FODMAP, and Reaction models complete
* Food CRUD 
* Log meals 
* Log known (basic) food allergies / reactions

## Planned Functionality
The below functionality is either in-progress or planned:

* Log food reactions based on system, type, and severity
* Track date and time of food intake 
* Track onset date, time, and duration of reaction
* Track FODMAP sensitivities / interactions


Additionally, I have the following stretch goals...
* Integrate with USDA project to allow scanning of registered barcodes for easier data entry (this is an older Android project I would like to revisit some day)
