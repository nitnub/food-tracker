# Food App (In-Progress)

In-progress client / server project for a web-based food and allergy tracking app I am working on. I plan to add this to my portfolio and deploy to AWS once I reach MVP (finalized server code and full server test coverage). This project is built with TypeScript, React, and PostgreSQL. I plan to use MUI for styling.

## Planned Functionality
The below functionality is either in-progress or planned:

* Expand test coverage
* Log food reactions based on system, type, and severity
* Track date and time of food intake 
* Track onset date, time, and duration of reaction
* Track FODMAP sensitivities / interactions
* Integrate with my separate [auth-server project](https://github.com/nitnub/auth-server) to enable secure sign-in
* Finalize styling and layout with MUI

Additionally, I have the following stretch goals...
* Integrate with USDA project to allow scanning of registered barcodes for easier data entry (this is an older Android project I would like to revisit some day!)
