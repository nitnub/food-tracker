# Food App (In-Progress)

In-progress project for a web-based food and allergy tracking app I am working on. I plan to add this to [my portfolio](https://nickbryant.dev/) and deploy to Azure once I achieve MVP as defined below. This project is built with C# using the ASP.NET Core MVC framework. I plan to use Bootstrap for styling.

## Current MVP Requirements

- [x] User authentication

- [x] All Food, FODMAP, and Reaction models complete

- [x] Food CRUD

- [x] Log meals

- [x] Log known (basic) food allergies / reactions

## Planned Functionality

The below functionality is either in-progress or planned:

- [x] Log food reactions based on system, type, and severity
- [x] Track date and time of food intake (integrate with calendar)
- [ ] Track onset date, time, and duration of reaction (integrate with calendar)
- [ ] Track FODMAP sensitivities / interactions

Additionally, I have the following stretch goals...

- [ ] Integrate with USDA project to allow scanning of registered barcodes for easier data entry (this is an older Android project I would like to revisit some day)
- [ ] Add "Pets" grouping to track pet food reactions.
