# Food App (In-Progress)

In-progress [client](https://github.com/nitnub/food-tracker/tree/main/client) / [server](https://github.com/nitnub/food-tracker/tree/main/server) project for a web-based food and allergy tracking app I am working on. I plan to add this to [my portfolio](https://nickbryant.dev/) and deploy to AWS once I achieve MVP as defined below. This project is built with TypeScript, React, and PostgreSQL. I plan to use MUI for styling.

## Current Definition of MVP 
* Finalized server-side code
* Full server-side test coverage
* E2E demo-ready utilizing Postman

## Planned Functionality
The below functionality is either in-progress (complete on the server side, but not yet implemented in UI) or planned:

* Expand test coverage
* Log food reactions based on system, type, and severity
* Track date and time of food intake 
* Track onset date, time, and duration of reaction
* Track FODMAP sensitivities / interactions
* Integrate with my separate [auth-server project](https://github.com/nitnub/auth-server) to enable secure sign-in


Additionally, I have the following stretch goals...
* Integrate with USDA project to allow scanning of registered barcodes for easier data entry (this is an older Android project I would like to revisit some day!)
